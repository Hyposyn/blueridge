# SnipOS 7 Beta
Welcome to SnipOS 7 Blue Ridge.

Version: Build 7000

SnipOS is an operating system simulator by Hyposyn Software. Remember, this is an operating system simulator, and is not to be compared to something like macOS Ventura, or Windows 11.

SnipOS 7 is the new, most powerful application that hyposyn has made on Snap! 

Featured Feature: Fusion (Beta)
Fusion lets you run two (supported) apps at once!

In OS7, (and OS6) we have decided to use applications curated by the hyposyn & Snap! community!

Here is some info for some apps for SnipOS 7!

LXP Studio
Hyposyn's most powerful DAW yet for advance users. with auto-play recording, over 15 piano instruments, and 10x faster then Hydro Tracks without turbo mode

Notebook
Notebook (or Analog Notebook) is the new way to take notes on SnipOS. Including page support and supports making your own novel up to 10 pages!*

Hyposyn Maps.
One of the most powerful applications on SnipOS 6, is a google maps alternative.
Press "Space" to set the location to a custom longitude and latitude.

All SnipOS 7 sessions come with 32HB (Hyposyn Bytes) to save the system from crashing. You can expand the storage using codes, though, it increases the chance of errors in applications like Paint and Notebook.
(Basically, a middle-ground between KB and MB, still in alpha testing though.)
